# module-2-challenge

Project started with designing the frame of the front page with google slide: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nHEdHdUFFlgqLlfWUVSz6W7yoss8SHqODp-REvHxZeU/edit#slide=id.g14821c9df76_0_0
Then html file was written with the semantic elements
Then CSS was applied.
I was not sure if I need to create another page for the 1st project
